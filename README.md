# 🧠 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines information retrieval and generative models to enhance the accuracy, relevance, and factual grounding of generated text. This repository contains an implementation of a basic RAG pipeline using modern NLP tools.

## 🚀 What is RAG?

RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, a hybrid approach in NLP where:

- A **retriever** component searches an external knowledge base (like a document store, database, or vector index).
- A **generator** (usually a language model) uses the retrieved documents to generate responses grounded in external information.

This architecture improves the factual correctness of generative models by reducing hallucination and enabling open-domain question answering and knowledge-based tasks.

## 📦 Features

- Document retrieval from local or remote sources
- Integration with vector stores (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma)
- Support for OpenAI, HuggingFace, or custom language models
- Prompt templating and response parsing
- Extensible pipeline for custom use cases
